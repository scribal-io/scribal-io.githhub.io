  > As COVID-19 impacts every aspect of our work and life, we have seen two yearsâ€™ worth of digital transformation in two months.  
  **--Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO - April 29, 2020**


Digital transformation has been a trend for many years and has recently accelerated: what are its key components?

* Technology and automation come into aspects of business which previously were manual and required in-person contact.
* More and more building blocks of a company's offering are obtained via subscriptions as oppposed to purchased outright or built from scratch - thus obscuring the traditional distinction between "buying" and "building."
* Companies face an increasing ability and need to base decisions on actual data - which flows in volumes that overwhelm a business's technical and analytical capacities.

In our many years working in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, we have seen time and again that companies which position themselves on the forward edge of emerging trends can get and maintain a strong competitive advantage in their market segment. Scribal exists to help you sharpen your digital edge.

We help our clients to:
- Analyze and *solve your own technology problems* rather than relying on pre-baked "solutions"
- Leverage *open source software* and techniques to maximize the impact of technology investments.
- Understand emerging trends in software and data technologies that can yield significant benefits from uptake.
- *Align IT and business organizations* in order to optimize for quick prototyping, rapid ideation and other practices employed by leading-edge technology companies.
