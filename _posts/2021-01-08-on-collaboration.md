title: On Workplace Collaboration 
---

What are ‘workplace collaboration tools’? Is email a collaboration tool? What about Google Sheets - is that a collaboration app? How about attending an in-person meeting? Is that somehow less of a collaborative experience than joining a Zoom call?  Yes, yes and no, not really.  

All the word *"collaboration"* really means is co-laboring or working together. There’s nothing new about it. It’s something people have always done and will always do.  So if you have built or deployed a ‘collaboration tool’, it's not very useful to describe it that way. 'Collaboration tool' tells us exactly nothing.  Instead say that you ‘have software that allows you to save a document in the cloud that other people can modify and annotate’ if that is what your tool happens to do.  Tell us what it does. And tell us what problem it solves.  Don’t worry so much about what it supposedly ‘is.’ Conversely, if you are a purchaser, look to solve particular problems that cause your company pain, rather than thinking of categories that universalize the ordinary into a quasi-spiritual principle.

Here are a few examples of collaboration tools, applications, and platforms, stated differently:

- **LinkedIn** creates a valuable forum around jobs and the workplace - it helps employers and job seekers make connections.
- **Github** allows individuals, teams and organizations to develop and share code. 
- **Twilio** enables companies to easily interact with customers, partners and others through SMS.
- **Stack Overflow** makes it possible for developers to get answers to their questions and to share knowledge with others.
- **Twitter** and **Facebook** (though not only business applications) provide an ability to advertise to and engage with customers through their social media platforms; and also the ability to learn from other businesses that have faced similar problems.

Looking beyond the feel-good buzzwords of ‘community building’ and ‘collaboration,' each of these tools demonstrates its value better when described in terms of what it actually does. Some don't even fit our imagined list of what collaborative tools are. Point is: let’s not allow buzzwords to block our understanding of how different tools address specific problems.  Then we can find the best possible path to alleviating problems that really need addressing.
