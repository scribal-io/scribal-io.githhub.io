title:  Ancillary Subscriptions for Non-Subscription Businesses
---

*More and more companies whose revenues are not based primarily on subscription commerce are offering subscriptions in specific segments. We explore some examples and ask "why is this happening now?"* 

<!--excerpt--> 

As mentioned in previous posts, many companies known for their advertising-based business models are broadening their offerings to include ancillary subscripitions. Let's look at a few varied offerings and consider the implications.

**Twitter Blue** is a subscription add-on to Twitter's consumer-facing timeline. Introduced in Australia and Canada last June, the offering was launched in the US (and New Zealand) earlier in November for a monthly fee of US$2.99/user/month. The benefits to the Blue subscriber include the ability to "undo" tweets before they appear in the timeline, ad-free acesss to articles from specified publications, and the ability to skin and style the client-side twitter apps. The intended audience for Twitter Blue is the power user: the benefits make the experience of using Twitter more pleasant and efficient.

**Twitter v2 API** This month Twitter also introduced a new version of its API. Access is now classified into three tiers - Essential (free to anyone, retrieve up to 500k tweets per month), Elevated (retrieve up to 2m tweets per month), and Managed (10m+ calls/month, dedicated account manager). Currenly, Managed is the only level which is paid, but the other two levels also contain elements of the subscription model (and a paid Elevated+ tier is anticipated). Users are required to register and indicate their intended use for the API. Access (API calls) are metered and controlled on a regular, monthly basis. The intended audience for the Twitter API subscription is the developer community - a broad swath which includes academics, independent researchers and companies looking to build additional functionality on top of Twitter capabilities.

**Facebook Fan Subscriptions** - is one of Meta's first forays into subscription commerce. It allows "influencers" who use Meta products such as Facebook and Instagram to monetize their followings by selling subscriptions. This is a specialized offering: Meta is not offering the subscriptions itself, but is offering its platform (including payments processing) to keep a key audience segment on its products.  Meta is fighting Apple's app store here as the subscripiton management tool of choice - not only is Meta charging no fees to the subscription providers, but it is offering creators direct control of the customer/fan relationship.

These three examples all represent very different kinds of subscriptions targeted at different audiences. What they have in common are: 
1. each ties a key user segment even more closely to the platform by providing benefits that deepen the customer relationship; and 
2. the subscriptions bring in ancillary revenue which supplements rather than supercedes revenue earned from targeted advertising. 

We believe that the trend will continue and more advertising-first companies will start offering ancillary subscriptions.
